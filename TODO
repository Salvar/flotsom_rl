Different parts of ship:
Medical/science - Add "glass" tiles to some rooms for labs/observation
Engineering - facilities control, maybe auto door cards, maps, secret tunnels?  Maybe repurpose 1 tile wide halls as secret tunnels?
Bridge/command?
Living Quarters
Hydroponics

Different ship types:
organic alien
sphere "maze"

Hexagon based ship? (Would one >- tile do it?)


Add a "BreatherAI" for creatures that need air.

Allow ability to nest AIs.  Ex. BreatherAI + HostileEnemy.
Breather only checks to see if they are in vacuum and need
to move towards O2.  Otherwise, HostileEnemy.

Allow you to "float" across space tiles.  Actor needs momentum (simple (dx,dy)) and a new Input Handler that moves them
every turn.  Bounce off walls? Or maybe stick to walls, since magnet boots.  No other actions possible if floating.
Means Breaches can actually be way more complicated, as you can cross them.

Energy powered Jetpack accessories can let you fly across space tiles, not losing control.

Space tiles will have their own animation timer that will shift all tiles along an axis, randomly generating new ones at the edge,
so it looks like orbiting.

Use an action point system where entities will just take a Tick action and activate when they accumulate enough ticks. Allows
for variable speed entities.
