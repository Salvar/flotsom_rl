Maybe simplify sectors to eliminate subsectors and set exit points.  Instead just provide one or more
exit points on each side and allow L shaped tunnels between two random exits?

Add a "BreatherAI" for creatures that need air.

Allow ability to nest AIs.  Ex. BreatherAI + HostileEnemy.
Breather only checks to see if they are in vacuum and need
to move towards O2.  Otherwise, HostileEnemy.

Allow you to "float" across space tiles.  Actor needs momentum (simple (dx,dy)) and a new Input Handler that moves them
every turn.  Bounce off walls? Or maybe stick to walls, since magnet boots.  No other actions possible if floating.
Means Breaches can actually be way more complicated, as you can cross them.
