#1! Fix post processing of tiles to use bitcodes to search for doors and do better cleaning of odd structures.
Store bitcodes in its own array so we can reuse it for wall mapping.
Add damaged wall tiles to tile sets.

Different parts of ship:
Medical/science - Add "glass" tiles to some rooms for labs/observation
Engineering - facilities control, maybe auto door cards, maps, secret tunnels?  Maybe repurpose 1 tile wide halls as secret tunnels?
Bridge/command?
Living Quarters
Hydroponics

Different ship types:
organic alien
sphere "maze"

Hexagon based ship? (Would one >- tile do it?)



Energy powered Jetpack accessories can let you fly across space tiles, not losing control.

Convert space tile animation to use a single array that just loops around each frame.

Use an action point system where entities will just take a Tick action and activate when they accumulate enough ticks. Allows
for variable speed entities.

Factions!

Create different factions.  Each faction will have allowed ship types, preferred damage type or upgrade to items, etc...
Different faction actors will be color coded.  You will have a reputation with different factions which determines how they act
towards you.  Actors will have 3 different AI groups: hostile, neutral, friendly and a default disposition.

Items:

Items need damage types and a clean way to add modifiers to them.

Info:

Add easy ability for entities to render a description for themselves.  Ex.
Actors may show faction and physical description, items will show description along with upgrades and stats.
